                            Its's simple: the more carbon pollution is in the air , the <br>
                            more the sun's energy gets trapped as heat. Which <br>
                            means things keep getting hotter. You've almost <br>

                                One can see from space how the human race has changed the Earth. Nearly all of the
                                available land
                                has
                                been cleared of forest and is now used for agriculture or urban development. The polar
                                icecaps are
                                shrinking and the desert areas are increasing. At night, the Earth is no longer dark,
                                but large
                                areas
                                are lit up. All of this is evidence that human exploitation of the planet is reaching a
                                critical
                                limit.
                                But human demands and expectations are ever-increasing. We cannot continue to pollute
                                the
                                atmosphere,
                                poison the ocean and exhaust the land.There isn’t any more available.

                    <p>
                        The atmosphere is a dynamic fluid that is continually in motion. Both its physical properties
                        and its rate and direction of motion are influenced by a variety of factors, including solar
                        radiation, the geographic position of continents, ocean currents, the location and orientation
                        of mountain ranges, atmospheric chemistry, and vegetation growing on the land surface. All these
                        factors change through time. Some factors, such as the distribution of heat within the oceans,
                        atmospheric chemistry, and surface vegetation, change at very short timescales. Others, such as
                        the position of continents and the location and height of mountain ranges, change over very long
                        timescales. Therefore, climate, which results from the physical properties and motion of the
                        atmosphere, varies at every conceivable timescale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Climate is often defined loosely as the average weather at a particular place, incorporating
                        such features as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and windiness. A more specific definition
                        would state that climate is the mean state and variability of these features over some extended
                        time period. Both definitions acknowledge that the weather is always changing, owing to
                        instabilities in the atmosphere. And as weather varies from day to day, so too does climate
                        vary, from daily day-and-night cycles up to periods of geologic time hundreds of millions of
                        years long. In a very real sense, climate variation is a redundant expression—climate is always
                        varying. No two years are exactly alike, nor are any two decades, any two centuries, or any two
                        millennia.
